TypeCatcher
===========

TypeCatcher allows you to search, browse, and download Google webfonts
for off-line use on the Linux desktop. You can preview fonts with
adjustable size and text.

On Ubuntu or Debian, it may be installed from the default repositories with:

    sudo apt-get install typecatcher

The most recent release is also available in a PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:andrewsomething/typecatcher
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install 

Pull requests and bug reports are welcome here. If Bazaar is more your style,
this began on [Launchpad and is still mirrored there](https://launchpad.net/typecatcher).
It can be [translated there as well](https://translations.launchpad.net/typecatcher).

TypeCatcher is licensed under the GPL 3.0.
